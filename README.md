# 8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item


Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable involves employing clear and structured coding practices. In my work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, I focused on writing modular and well-documented code. Using clear function names, and comments. By breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, manageable functions within the CRUD module, I aimed for maintainability and adaptability. 

The advantages of this approach were evident when integrating the CRUD module into the dashboard for Project Two. The module's structured design allowed for seamless integration, reducing the complexity of connecting dashboard widgets to the database. Reusing this CRUD module in the future for different projects or within various sections of a larger project could significantly expedite development. For instance, the same module could be utilized to connect other applications to the database, ensuring consistency and reducing development time.

As a computer scientist, my approach to solving problems involves breaking down the requirements into manageable components. For the database and dashboard requirements Grazioso Salvare requested, I began by understanding the client's needs and then designed the solution iteratively. This project differed from prior assignments by integrating multiple technologies (like Dash, PyMongo, and Pandas) to create an end-to-end solution. To meet other client requests in the future, I would employ similar techniques, focusing on understanding client needs, selecting appropriate technologies, and designing modular solutions to facilitate scalability and flexibility.

Computer scientists tackle challenges by utilizing computational thinking, problem-solving, and algorithmic reasoning. Our work matters because it enables companies like Grazioso Salvare to streamline their operations. The dashboard I developed empowers Grazioso Salvare to analyze their animal rescue data efficiently, make informed decisions, and improve their rescue operations. By providing clear insights and a user-friendly interface, the dashboard enhances their ability to manage and allocate resources effectively, ultimately improving their overall workflow and mission effectiveness. This type of project demonstrates how computer science expertise can directly impact organizational efficiency and decision-making.
